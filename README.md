# 🎓 Educational Platform – UML & OOP Project

This repository contains the design and implementation of a basic structure for an **educational platform** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **UML class diagrams**.

The system models a platform where:

- Teachers can create and manage courses.
- Students can enroll in courses and participate in sessions.
- Evaluations and certificates are generated based on participation and progress.

The main focus of the project is on understanding class design, modeling relationships, and applying software engineering principles to simulate a real-world educational environment.
