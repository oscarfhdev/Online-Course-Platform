# 🎓 Online Course Platform – UML & OOP Project

This repository contains the design and implementation of a basic structure for an **educational platform** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **UML class diagrams**.

The system models a platform where:

- We can create and manage courses.
- We can enroll in courses and participate in sessions.
- Evaluations and certificates are generated based on participation and progress.

The main focus of the project is on understanding class design, modeling relationships, and applying software engineering principles to simulate a real-world educational environment.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java** – Core language for implementation  
- **IntelliJ IDEA** – Integrated Development Environment  
- **Modelio** – UML modeling tool used to design class diagrams

## 📚 What We've Learned

Throughout this project, we explored the fundamentals and application of software modeling and object-oriented development. Specifically, we:

- Defined **classes, attributes, methods**, and explored different types of **relationships** (association, aggregation, inheritance).
- Chose and configured a UML modeling tool (**Modelio**) to design class diagrams.
- Interpreted and explained diagrams, identifying how each part translates into code.
- Created **UML class diagrams from written specifications**, simulating a typical software design workflow.
- **Generated Java code** from our diagrams and enhanced it with real logic.
- Improved our ability to **present technical work**, explain design decisions, and document the process clearly.
